# Alpine Linux Rootfs Solution

## Problem

The initial attempts to create a minimal rootfs with busybox failed due to RISC-V Vector extension incompatibility:

1. **Custom-built busybox** from source was compiled with vector extensions (v1.0, zve*) by the RISC-V toolchain
2. **QEMU virt machine** doesn't support vector extensions by default
3. Result: `illegal instruction` (SIGILL) crash when running busybox

## Attempted Solutions

1. **Rebuild with explicit ISA**: Tried `-march=rv64imafdc` in CFLAGS but toolchain still added vector extensions
2. **QEMU with vector support**: Tried `-cpu rv64,v=true` but QEMU terminated immediately
3. **Disable hardware acceleration**: Fixed SHA build errors but didn't solve vector issue

## Working Solution: Alpine Linux

Alpine Linux provides pre-built RISC-V root filesystems that are:
- ✅ Built without vector extensions (rv64imafdc only)
- ✅ Fully compatible with QEMU virt machine
- ✅ Complete with busybox and standard utilities
- ✅ Lightweight (~3.8MB compressed base)

### Implementation

```bash
# Download Alpine RISC-V minirootfs
wget https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.21/releases/riscv64/alpine-minirootfs-3.21.0-riscv64.tar.gz

# Extract to rootfs directory
tar xzf alpine-minirootfs-3.21.0-riscv64.tar.gz -C rootfs_alpine/

# Copy PyTorch libraries
cp -r rootfs_minimal/usr/local/lib/* rootfs_alpine/usr/local/lib/
cp -r rootfs_minimal/lib/* rootfs_alpine/lib/

# Create initramfs
cd rootfs_alpine
find . -print0 | cpio --null --create --format=newc | gzip -9 > ../initramfs_alpine.cpio.gz
```

### Verification

Check ISA extensions in Alpine's busybox:
```bash
$ readelf -A rootfs_alpine/bin/busybox | grep arch
  Tag_RISCV_arch: "rv64i2p1_m2p0_a2p1_f2p2_d2p2_c2p0_zicsr2p0_zifencei2p0_zmmul1p0_zaamo1p0_zalrsc1p0"
```

No vector extensions (v, zve*, zvl*) present! ✅

## Benefits

1. **No compilation needed** - Use pre-built binaries
2. **Guaranteed compatibility** - Alpine tests on QEMU
3. **Well-maintained** - Regular Alpine releases
4. **Lightweight** - Only ~63MB with PyTorch included
5. **Complete toolset** - All standard busybox utilities work

## Alternative: Debian/Ubuntu with debootstrap

While debootstrap was considered, it has limitations in container environments:
- Requires binfmt_misc for chroot
- Needs systemd or manual second-stage completion
- More complex setup for RISC-V cross-architecture

Alpine's approach is simpler and more reliable for this use case.

## Files Modified

- `run_qemu.sh` - Updated to use `initramfs_alpine.cpio.gz`
- `rootfs_alpine/` - New directory with Alpine base + PyTorch
- `initramfs_alpine.cpio.gz` - New initramfs (63MB vs 935MB original)

## Conclusion

Using Alpine Linux's pre-built RISC-V root filesystem completely solved the vector extension incompatibility issue and provides a clean, maintainable solution for running PyTorch on QEMU RISC-V full system emulation.
